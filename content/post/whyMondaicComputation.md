I won't go into the details of what a Monad is and what exactly it solves. What we will do here is try to come up with a monadic type to encapsulate network result. We will do a side by side comparison with the traditional/classical/imperative and the functional (monadic) approach. In the end you should be able to appreciate and hopefully use the monadic style of wrapping network result without being bothered about the nitty gritty details of what a monad is?

I will definitely do a long exhaustive article on monad in the weeks to come.

## Problem
Almost a month ago, I wrote a lengthy article on [implementing Functor in swift](https://kandelvijaya.com/2017/05/28/fp-functor/). I want to write a Xcode Playground code to fetch the content from that link, stringify it, and count the occurrence of word "functor" in the whole article. Pretty basic stuff.

NOTE: to make async calls and get the eventual result, you will need ask playground to keep the execution indefinite.
```swift
import PlaygroundSupport
...
...
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true  //I prefer to have this at the end of all the code
```

## 1 way
Heres my Network Service Class
```swift
public class NetworkService {

    private let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
    private var task: URLSessionDataTask?

    private var eventualResult: Data? {
        didSet {
            if let eventualResult = eventualResult {
                onComplete?(eventualResult)
            }
        }
    }

    public var onComplete: ((Data) -> Void)?

    public init(url: URL) {
        task = session.dataTask(with: url) { [weak self] (data, response, error) in
            if let _ = error { return }
            if response == nil || data == nil { return }
            self?.eventualResult = data
        }
        task?.resume()
    }

}
```

And here's the code to solve the problem:
```swift
private let url = URL(string: "https://kandelvijaya.com/2017/05/28/fp-functor/")!
let service1 = NetworkService(url: url)
service1.onComplete = onReceiving

func onReceiving(data: Data) {
    let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) ?? ""
    do {
        let regexp = try NSRegularExpression(pattern: "functor", options: .caseInsensitive)
        let matches = regexp.matches(in: string, options: [], range: NSMakeRange(0, string.count))
        print(matches.count)
    } catch {
        print("Errored! Throw me")
    }

}

```

**Discussion**:

- Lets be honest, the code above does what it needs to. A slight problem, what happens if the url returns different resource i.e. image, video or anything else. What happens if the network connection dies, or other 99 problems occur? Simple; Ignorance. A fools weapon to discard everything.
- The code has small surface area, but we already know when it can break.
- Errors are part of what we do, shall we ignore them? We need to handle them.

## 2 Way
A bit seasoned developer knows error are part of what we do. So he/she treats them fairly.
And he/she knows about a thing called `Result` enum to gather the choice of either `failure(e)` or `success(v)` where `e` and `v` represent either Error or Value.

#### Let me rephrase this in a bit more depth.

Think: When you make a network or database or async request to get some value `Value`, 2 things could happen eventually. You either get that Value **OR** you get a error. Aha, we have 2 choice. Can we represent this choice with a type? Yes, we can.

- What is choice type? ==> Algebric Sum type.
- What is the other type then? ==> Product type.
- Sum Type ==> `Enum`
- Product Type ==> `Tuple`, `Struct`, `Class`

Fair enough, lets mode this property with `enums`.

```swift
enum Result<Value> {
    case failure(Error)
    case success(Value)
}
```

Had we modeled this type with struct like such:
```swift
struct Result<Value> {
    let failure: Error?
    let success: Value?
}
```
The result I will get could potentially have both failure and success values set. What would that mean? Struct is a product type and hence is not suitable for modeling choice.

### Moving on.... 2 Way
With Result type at hand, we can refactor the NetworkService class to derive this codebase which treats errors and collects in the eventualValue.

```swift
class NetworkService<T> {

    private enum ResponseError: Error {
        case badOrIncompleteFormat
        case incompatibleEventualValue
    }

    private let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
    private var task: URLSessionDataTask?

    //1.
    private var eventualResult: Result<T>? {
        didSet {
            if let eventualResult = eventualResult {
                onComplete?(eventualResult)
            }
        }
    }

    var onComplete: ((Result<T>) -> Void)?

    init(url: URL) {
        task = session.dataTask(with: url) { [weak self] (data, response, error) in
            if let error = error {
                self?.eventualResult = .failure(error)
                return
            }
            if response == nil || data == nil {
                self?.eventualResult = .failure(ResponseError.badOrIncompleteFormat)
                return
            }
            //2.
            guard let dataT = data as? T else {
                self?.eventualResult = .failure(ResponseError.incompatibleEventualValue)
                return
            }
            self?.eventualResult = Result<T>.success(dataT)
        }
        task?.resume()
    }

}

```

And then the calling side would look like this:
```swift
private let url = URL(string: "https://kandelvijaya.com/2017/05/28/fp-functor/")!
let service2 = NetworkService<Data>(url: url)
service2.onComplete = onReceiveImperative

func onReceiveImperative(result: Result<Data>) {
    switch result {
    case let .failure(e):
        print(e)
    case let .success(v):
        let dataString = convertDataToString(data: v)
        switch dataString {
        case let .failure(e):
            print(e)
        case let .success(s):
            let functorCount = countFunctorOccurance(on: s)
            print(functorCount)
        }
    }
}

```


Discussion:

- `convertDataToString` and `countFunctorOccurance` are utility functions that we have refactored out to make the nested switch obvious.
- With `NetworkService<T>`, we did our best to handle all the errors that could occur and accumulate it on the `eventualResult` which will be sent to the client.
- `onReceiveImperative` is having to deal with unwrapping and passing 2 times as we have to use 2 different functions to complete the problem at hand. If we had 10 functions to chain to solve this problem, we will definitely have 10 nested switch statement. Similar to the Callback hell, Switch hell. This is the only pain point we have at the moment.


## Way 3
What if we can pack this unwrap and pass to function in a utility function. This would help eliminate the nested switch levels. Lets try:

```swift
extension Result {

    func unwrapAndPass<B>(to function: ((Value) -> Result<B>)) -> Result<B> {
        switch self {
        case let  .failure(e):
            return .failure(e)
        case let .success(v):
            return function(v)
        }
    }

}

```

So the extension function above does what we want. It unwraps the current result, if there is a result, passes the result to the function. If there is error, it returns the error.

Lets see how this helped the call site:
```swift
func onReceiveFunctional(result: Result<Data>) {
     let count = result.unwrapAndPass(to: convertDataToString).unwrapAndPass(to: countFunctorOccurance)
     print(count)
}
```

Sweet! üëè

Moreover, if you like operatorOverloading then it becomes much more readable and important: we preserve all the error handling.
```swift
func onReceiveFunctional(result: Result<Data>) {
    let count = result >>= convertDataToString >>= countFunctorOccurance
    print(count)
}
```

How cool is that? üëèüëè

The operator overloads are defined like this:
```swift
precedencegroup BindPrecedence {
    higherThan: BitwiseShiftPrecedence
    associativity: left
}
infix operator >>=: BindPrecedence

func >>= <T,U>(_ lhs: Result<T>, _ rhsFunc: ((T) -> Result<U>)) -> Result<U> {
    switch lhs {
    case let  .failure(e):
        return .failure(e)
        case let .success(v):
        return rhsFunc(v)
    }
}

```

In fact, what we did is just wrap `unwrapAndPass` with the operator `>>=`. Nothing fancy. But clearly more readable!

## what happens if I have 10 different small functions to do the job.
==> Chain them and be done. No need to unwrap and pass and switch everywhere.
```swift
    let count = result >>= fn1 >>= fn2 >>= fn3 >>= .... >>= fn10  
```


#### Lets step back and see the code for the 2 utility functions now:
```swift
enum TransformingError: Error {
    case conversionError
    case caughtException
}

func convertDataToString(data: Data) -> Result<String> {
    guard let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else {
        return .failure(TransformingError.conversionError)
    }
    return Result<String>.success(string)
}

func countFunctorOccurance(on stringContent: String) -> Result<Int> {
    do {
        let regexp = try NSRegularExpression(pattern: "functor", options: .caseInsensitive)
        let matches = regexp.matches(in: stringContent, options: [], range: NSMakeRange(0, stringContent.count))
        return .success(matches.count)
    } catch {
        return .failure(TransformingError.caughtException)
    }
}
```


## Digesting Monadic operation

1. Lets take a look at `Result<V>`. Result represents computation that could fail.
![Result Type image](/img/resultType.png)
2. Lets see the functions `convertDataToString` and `countFunctorOccurance`; both have the signature `f:: X -> Result<Y>`. Each function takes a input of `X` and returns final value `Y` with the possible additional effect of failure captured by `Result`.
![Monadic functions a -> M b](/img/monadicFunction.png)
3. Given we have `Result<A>` and a function of type `(A) -> Result<B>`, how do we compose them?
![How to compose Monad and mondaic function?](/img/howToMonadicCompose.png)
4. We can unwrap the first `Result<A>` and if it has a proper value, we pass to the function of type `(A) -> Result<B>`, if there was a error on the first `Result<A>`, we simply return that error, never calling the other function. i.e. `unwrapAndPass` or fnacy `>>=`
![Composing monadically](/img/composingMonadicallyWithUnwrapAndPass.png)
And if you could imagine, the dark gray path is the failure path, while the dark green to be the success path, then we one can imagine chaining multiple functions with `>>=` into the 2 tracked railway. In fact, there is a wonderfully smart talk about the Railway Oriented Programming, check it out if that interests you.
{{< vimeo 113707214 >}}
And this is the [Railway Oriented Programming article](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/).


## One more thing `Optional`
If you take a look at how optional chaining works, this is exactly railway oriented programming.

For instance:
```swift
a?.callFirstFunction()?.callOnThat()
```
If a happens to be `nil` or `.none`, then eventual result will be `nil`. So `?` is very similar to our `unwrapAndPass` or `>>=` operator. Imagine, how many switch case would you have to type if there was no such sequencing or monadic composing.

## Conclusion:
1. Choice Type | Sum Type | Enums are great at modeling mutually exclusive choice. Sum types are great for pattern matching. `switch .. case` can simulate lots of pattern matching.
2. Encapsulating async result in `Result<T>` type and providing `unwrapAndPass` or `>>=` enables one to get the goodies of additional effect (error in our case) handling without having to manually clutter the code with nested `switch ... case`.
3. Don't ignore errors, handle them.
4. `unwrapAndPass` or `>>=` is the composition unit in Functional Programming for Monad (I will get deep into what a monad is next time around) and enables one to do railway oriented programming.
