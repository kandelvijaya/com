# What is a Monoid?
Monoid is a property of a system which satisfies these three laws:

- **Has identity**
- Is composable and the order of composition doesnot matter: i.e. **composition is associative**
- The result of composing 2 such system produces similar system. i.e **Closure property** or endomorphism. 

Well, that sounds a bit abstract. Indeed. Well, is this any useful in programming? You bet it is. 

This post is entirely about understanding what a monoid is, with ideas we (OOP) programmers already know. To do so, I will do a addition on data models (bill) and then discuss the flaws, our imperative system has. And then, we will see how monoids naturally come to our rescue. 

One thing you need to have in mind as we go is that all we are trying to do is composability of smaller functions to build something useful. 

**Monoid** is not a direct relative of **Monad**. *It is not a semi-monad or a smaller form of Monad. Its a separate concept that has not much to do with Monad*

## Problem
Let say we are making a POS(Point Of Sale) application where given a bunch of BillReceipts we need to calculate and print the total amount. Jack happens to be our loyal frequent customer. 

Lets assume the data model for the `BillReceipt` is as follows:
```swift
struct BillReceipt {
    let name: String
    let quantity: Int
    let totalPrice: Double
}
```

And here we have a list of items Jack ordered. 

```swift
let mangoBill = BillReceipt(name: "Mango", quantity: 2, totalPrice: 1.5)
let orangeBill = BillReceipt(name: "Orange", quantity: 3, totalPrice: 2)
let spagettiBill = BillReceipt(name: "Spagetti", quantity: 1, totalPrice: 2.1)

// then
let allReceipts = [mangoBill, orangeBill, spagettiBill]
```

Now we need to total them up and ask for money. Fair and easy. Lets do this. 

We will now go through couple of ways one might tackle this problem. However, our aim is to eventually refine to and try to reach a monoidal approach. Lets get going.

## 1. Imperative (Von Neumann's Word at a time processing)
```swift
func total(_ bills: [BillReceipt]) {
    var totalPrice = 0.0
    var totalQuantity = 0

    for index in allReceipts {
	// Picking each element:: Von Neumann's Word at Time processing
        totalPrice += index.totalPrice
        totalQuantity += index.quantity
    }
    
    print("Impure Totaling Fucntion:")
    print("Total")
    print("Quantity \t\t",totalQuantity)
    print("Total Price \t", totalPrice)
    print("\n")
}

```

### Disucssion:
- Whats good?
  - Its very simple. 
- Whats not good?
  - Lets say we processed Jacks total. But wait, lets say Jack quickly runs to get some bananas (Unlike most of us, he has the last minute recalling what he forgot to grab from the market). We would have to add bananaReceipt to the allBills list and compute everything over again. **We can't just add only bananasReceipt to the total we obtained earlier.** 
  - The code is picking a receipt and mutating the accumulators. This is item at a time processing. Lets redo this atleast with nice functional programming skills under our belt. 
  
  
  
## 2. Functional (Declarative)
```swift
let total = allReceipts.reduce((0.0, 0)) { ($0.0 + $1.totalPrice, $0.1 + $1.quantity) }

// Printing is left out intentionally
```
### Discussion:
- Whats good?
  - Its quite simple. 
  - We are declarative. We are now not concerned about each element in the list. This is what it means to get rid of Word at time processing. 
  - concise code.
- Whats not so good?
  - Not much besides the arbitary initial value tuple `(0.0, 0)`. 
  - We need to update the initial value tuple when later on we change the information we want to extract from the Receipt. 
  - More importantly, we haven't quite dealt with how we could address Jack's problem to buying more stuff after we processed his bills. Jack goes to buy bananas on last minute here too. Here's how we might solve it.
  
  ```swift
  let bananaBill = BillReceipt(...)
  let totalYetAgain = (total.0 + bananaBill.price, total.1 + bananaBill.quantity)
  ```
  - Does this look Ad-hoc hack to support incremental addition. Lets see what Monoid has to offer.

## 3. Monoidal Addition:
```swift
//1.
extension BillReceipt {

    static func add(_ first: BillReceipt, _ second: BillReceipt) -> BillReceipt {
        let addedPrice = first.totalPrice + second.totalPrice
        let addedQuantity = first.quantity + second.quantity
        let addedName = "Total"
        return BillReceipt(name: addedName, quantity: addedQuantity, totalPrice: addedPrice)
    }

}

//2.
let totalPureMonoidal = allReceipts.reduce(WHATDOIPUTHERE, BillReceipt.add)

```

Here, we defined a `add` as type function that takes two `BillRecipt`s and returns added result in a `BillReceipt`. **This is the First Law of Monoid called Closure Property**. 

- i.e `add :: BillReceipt -> BillReceipt -> BillReceipt` on curried notation.
- similar to `add:: Int -> Int -> Int` for `add(Int, Int) -> Int`
- Note that for closure property; **return type must match the input argument type** 


Nice!!! (*It really doesnot matter if this is a instance or type function. I chosed type function because its easy to plug into list.reduce. See point 2 above*)

Make note of **`WHATDOIPUTHERE`** up in the code. So what is the initial value? Lets take a moment and do addtion on Ints and String.  

```swift
let sum = [1,2,3,4].reduce(0, +)
let product = [1,2,3,4].reduce(1, *)
let joinedString = ["Hello", "  ", " there ", "^-^"].reduce("", +)

// Keep an eye on this one too
[1,2,3,4].reduce(0, -)
```

All of this above methods have a clear defined inital values.

- In case of `Int +` we have `0`. i.e. `x + 0 = x` or `0 + x = x` 
- In case of `Int *` we have `1`. i.e. `x * 1 = x`
- In case of `String +` we have `""`. i.e `string + "" = string`


From the above observation, Its obvious that the initial Value for reduce is more likely the `identity` for `Types operation`. Now the question is, what is the identity for our `BillReceipt` type's `add()` function?

#### Searching for BillReceipt Identity

So lets default all the values of member to their identity and hope we will find one. 
```swift
extension BillReceipt {
    init() {
        name = ""
        quantity = 0
        totalPrice = 0
    }
}
```

- *Please note that, I extended Struct and added init() so that I will also get the default memberwise initializer that structs gives us for free. I now have both initializer. If you implement this `init()` inside the Struct then the memberwise initializer is not provided*



So here we are:
```swift
let totalPureMonoidal = allReceipts.reduce(BillReceipt(), BillReceipt.add)
```

### Disucssion:
- Whats good?
  - Still everything is simple.
  - We factored out additon logic to a small function.
  - We saw `Closure property` and `Indentity` for `BillReceipt's add() operation`
  - If Jack goes to buy banans late, as he always does, then we can incrementally add his banana receipt without any hack. 
  
  ```swift
  let totalWithLastMinuteBananas = BillReceipt.add(totoalPureMonoidal, bananaReceipt)
  ```
- Whats not good?
  - We have yet to see the `Associativity` law. 
  - We are ignoring the `name` property of `BillReceipt` while doing the `add()` operation. What if BillReceipt were to have more fields like `pricePerItem: Double`. What do we do when we add 2 such structs?
  
```swift
extension BillReceipt {

    static func add(_ first: BillReceipt, _ second: BillReceipt) -> BillReceipt {
        let addedPrice = first.totalPrice + second.totalPrice
        let addedQuantity = first.quantity + second.quantity
        let addedName = "Total"
        let addedPricePerItem = ...... //WATTTT TO DO HERE
        return BillReceipt(name: addedName, quantity: addedQuantity, totalPrice: addedPrice)
    }

}

```
  
### Associativity 
First off, lets get this associativity right. 

These are associative as the order of operation application doesnot matter. 
```swift
(1 + 2) + 3 == 1 + (2 + 3)
(4 * 5) * 7 == 4 * (5 * 7)
("Hello " + "there") + "Monoid"  == "Hello " + ("there" + "Monoid")
```

However, substraction although had `identity` and `closure` property doesnot hold true for associativity.
```swift
(1 - 2) - 3 != 1 - (2 - 3)
```

Thus, from the laws for monoid. 

- Addition on Int/Double is Monoid
- Multiplication on Int/Double is Monoid
- String concatnation is Monoid.

However, 

- Substraction on Int/Double is not Monoid as it is not associative.
- Similar for Division.

**What about `add` on `BillReceipt`?**

- It fulfills closure property. 
  
  ```swift
  // When we apply .add() the result is same type as the input type
  BillReceipt.add(mangoBill, BillReceipt(name: "Pizza", quantity: 3, totalPrice: 9.5)) is BillReceipt
  ```
- It fulfills associativite property.
  
  ```swift
  // This allows our reduce function to be parallelized if necessary
  let addedLeft = BillReceipt.add(BillReceipt.add(mangoBill, orangeBill), spagettiBill)
  let addedRight = BillReceipt.add(mangoBill, BillReceipt.add(orangeBill, spagettiBill))
  addedLeft == addedRight             // similar to (1 + 2) + 3 == 1 + (2 + 3)
  ```
- It has a proper identity.  
  
  ```swift
  BillReceipt.add(mangoBill, BillReceipt()) == mangoBill // similar to 1 + 0 = 1
  BillReceipt.add(BillReceipt(), orangeBill) == orangeBill
  ```

- `add` on `BillReceipt` is a Monoid.âœ…ðŸ’ª


# Why the fuss? Why the Monoid? 
Before going too far, lets appreciate what have we got from Monoids.

## Benifits of Associativity
- Parallelization. Take for instance how Hadoop works? 
  
  ```swift
  12 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 100 + 20 + 13
  ==> Core1 (12 + 10)     | Core2 (6 + 9) | Core3(100 + 20) | Core4 (13) 
  ==> Core1(22 + 15)      | Core2(...)    | Core3(120 + 13) | Core4(...)
  ==> Core1(37 + 133)     | Core2(...)    | Core3(...)      | Core4(...)
  ==> Core1(170)          | Core2(...)    | Core3(...)      | Core4(...)
  ```

- Incrementalism
  We saw this one before with Jack's last minute bananas purchase addition.

- Divide And Conquer
  The first point on parallelization is good example of how a compiler might choose to divide and conquer strategy. 
  
- Composability

## Benifits of Closure
- a pairwise operation (binary operation) can be converted to work on lists and sequences **for free**.
  
  ```swift
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 
  [1,2,3,4].reduce(0, +)
  ```

## Identity
Identity helps us answer what do we do in these situations:
- How to `reduce` on a empty list? What is the initial value of the `reduce`?

```swift
[].reduce(BillReceipt(), BillReceipt.add)
[Int]().reduce(0, +) //sum of empty list of ints is 0
```
- Provides either a starting data when the list of addition to make is a empty list. Provides terminal data when using divide and conquer algorithms. 


# Sum it up
Despite the fact that we didn't saw much of theory behind Monoid and how category theory pictographically describes Monoid, we did create a Monoid for us. The above problem helped us understand that if we end up having a Monoid, we can do list comprehension using `reduce` for free. We can parallelize and incrementally add operations on to the result. 

In the end, if I have one senetence to sum it up: Monoid is a way to describe aggregation pattern. List comprehension using `reduce` is just a prime example of it.
