My name is Bj (spelled `Vijaya`). I am a Software Engineer specialized in developing apps for Apple Ecosystem (iOS, MacOS*). I currently work as Engineering Manager at [Zalando SE](https://corporate.zalando.com/en/company) leading the best in class Backend Driven UI Mobile Framework. 

Programming Languages (Haskell, Swift, ReScript, Scheme), Functional Programming Paradigm & System Design are some of my top current interests. I am easily distracted by new technical advancement and spend countless hours getting to the depth of them out of curiosity. One example; every evenining I spent reading emacs guide for a month; used emacs for few years and fell in love with org mode, built parser for swift, created iOS app for it and I use it personally. I had fun. Most of the content in this blog are either my journey into such deep paths or outcomes I want to share. There is a new blog when I get time to explore.
