      <description>Time is what we want most, but what we use worst. -William Pen
 Timestamp is a very important issue we deal with in every single iOS/OSX project. Unlike timestamp, sometimes we want to measure method performance. Practically, i would use it for fun exploration. However, there are cases especially in games development where the precise time helps maintain consistent gameplay with scores. I explored a bit on how we can leverage the systems provided APIs to just get the current time stamp as precisely as possible.</description>
