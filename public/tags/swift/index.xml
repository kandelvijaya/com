      <description>When to refactor legacy code? Last few releases, I was working on a fairly old code. I was required to implement a small new feature; a item list controller. The controller maintains list of items in horizontal collection view.
We were using this controller to show remote items and last seen items (local). Now the new feature was to use another api URL and then transform the received content into appropriate items.</description>

      <description>Time is what we want most, but what we use worst. -William Pen
 Timestamp is a very important issue we deal with in every single iOS/OSX project. Unlike timestamp, sometimes we want to measure method performance. Practically, i would use it for fun exploration. However, there are cases especially in games development where the precise time helps maintain consistent gameplay with scores. I explored a bit on how we can leverage the systems provided APIs to just get the current time stamp as precisely as possible.</description>
